    <th>A pseudo-regular RSRG graph is constructed and the plots for degree distribution, eigenvalue distribution and Also, the parameters of spectral gap, natural connectivity, symmetry ratio, energy and Laplacian energy  is drawn.Next we Choose one from the set of p values in each step and Calculate values for that and run 100 to 1000 times . then we calculated average algebraic connection by Monte Carlo simulation and plot the probability density distribution for the allowed values of d .</th>

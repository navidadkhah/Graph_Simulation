    <th>A pseudo-regular RSRG graph is constructed and the plots for degree distribution, eigenvalue distribution and Also, the parameters of spectral gap, natural connectivity, symmetry ratio, energy and Laplacian energy  is drawn.Next we Choose one from the set of p values in each step and Calculate values for that and run 100 to 1000 times . then we calculated average algebraic connection by Monte Carlo simulation and plot the probability density distribution for the allowed values of d .</th>

    <th>In this part , 100 nodes are considered for each graph. from the function bipartite.random_graph We create a random bipartite graph. Then, using bipartite.projected_graph, project the bipartite graph on the first set of nodes to obtain the recursive bipartite graph without measure S. Finally, the degree distribution and The PDF is calculated and plotted.</th>

In the next step, we divide the production of SF graphs into categories that Each batch contains the number of batch_size  (ten).  after producing each batch, We print the progress. We calculate the average degree for each network size by generating num_graphs SF graphs for each size and their average degrees. Then  we get the Average degree plot drawn based on the size of the corresponding network.</th>
